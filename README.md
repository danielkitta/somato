Somato: Soma cube animation
===========================

Somato solves and animates Piet Hein's Soma cube puzzle.
From Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_cube>:

The Soma cube is a solid dissection puzzle invented by Piet Hein during a
lecture on quantum mechanics conducted by Werner Heisenberg. Seven pieces made
out of unit cubes must be assembled into a 3x3x3 cube. The pieces can also be
used to make a variety of other interesting 3D shapes.

The pieces of the Soma cube consist of all possible combinations of four or
fewer unit cubes, excluding all regular shapes (i.e., the 1x1x1, 1x1x2, 1x1x3,
1x1x4 and 1x2x2 cuboids). This leaves just one three-block piece and six
four-block pieces, of which two form an enantiomorphic pair. A similar puzzle
consisting solely of all eight four-block pieces (including the cuboids) would
contain 32 unit cubes and, thus, could not be assembled into a cube.
